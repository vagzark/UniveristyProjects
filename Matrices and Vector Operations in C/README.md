# Matrices and Vector Operations in C

This is my first ever project in the university. It is called Matrices and Vector Operation and it is implemented in C. This is the project that got me into the world of programming and it has a special place in my heart.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Matrices and Vector Operations in C. This is my first ever programming project as part of the Structured Programming course at my university. Although it might be the best and most complicated project out there, it has a special place in my heart because this is the project that got me into programming. It is a simple C-based program that can perform various operations between matrices and vectors.

## Features

- **Array Insertion**: insert an array from a .txt file which should be stored in the same folder as the .c file.
- **Vector Insertion**: insert a vector from a .txt file which should be stored in the same folder as the .c file.
- **Array Display**: print a specific or all the arrays that you have inserted in the program.
- **Vector Display**: print a specific or all the vectors that you have inserted in the program.
- **Matrix operation**: execute addition/subtraction/multiplication between the arrays that you have inserted.
- **Vector operation**: execute addition/subtraction/dot product/cross product between the vectors that you have inserted.
- **Array deletion**: delete an array that you have inserted.
- **Vector deletion**: delete a vector that you have inserted.
- **Exit the program**: terminate the program.

## Usage

As soon as you run the program, a selection menu appears on the screen.

If you want to insert a matrix, make sure that you have .txt file with your matrix stored in the same folder as the .c file of the project. You get asked to input the dimension and the name of the file.
For example, I want to add a 3x3 matrix from the file matrix1.txt

You can do the same process to insert a vector.

After inserting some matrices and/or vectors, you can print them by selecting if you want to print 1 or every matrix/vector that has been inserted. For example, in the example below, I choose to print the 1st matrix I inserted

Then you can do operations between the matrices and between the vectors that you have insterted and save the result in another .txt file that will get saved in the same folder as the .c file.
Keep in mind that in order to do the operations, you must follow the rules that apply to operations between matrices and vectors, otherwise the program won't allow you to do the operation.

In the example bellow we multiply 2 matrices and we save the results in another file called results.txt

Finally you can delete any matrix or vector that you have inserted. For example, in the example below, I choose to delete the 1st matrix I inserted:

At any time, you can select option 9 to terminate the program.

## Notes
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the files that contain the matrices and the vectors are in a .txt file and they have the same layout as the ones in the examples that I have uploaded


> [!NOTE]
> When a matrix/vector is deleted, their space gets empty and is not replaced by another matrix/vector
