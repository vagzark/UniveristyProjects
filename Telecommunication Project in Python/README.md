# Constellation Design for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power
Transfer (SWIPT)

This is a project that was created by me and my classmate Victoria (https://github.com/vic5678) for the class Communication Systems II, This project is about Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer. We were given the 2 papers that I have uploaded and the assignments were:

- Fig. 2 in [R1] represents the PAPR behavior versus 𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑛 of 16-Circular QAM compared with known modulation schemes, namely 16-PAM, 16-PSK, and 16-QAM. Provide theoretical analysis about PAPR versus 𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑛 for all the above constellations and verify the results in Fig. 2 through simulation.
- Fig. 3 in [R1] illustrates SEP versus normalized harvested energy of the modulation schemes for fixed SNR. Furthermore, Fig. 4 in [R1] illustrates SEP versus SNR for fixed normalized energy harvesting. Verify these results through both theoretical analysis and simulation results. Include in your analysis, one of the state-of-the-art constellation schemes for SWIPT presented in [R2].

The results that we got are all in detail in the project report I have uploaded.
